================================================================================
PHASE 6 — BOOSTER LOGIC (HIGH)
================================================================================
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Commit: 4ca8521
Priority: High

OBJECTIVES:
- Implement 30-day booster tracker (3 directs with investments)
- Add UI countdown timer

FILES MODIFIED:
✓ server/services/booster.service.ts
  - Fixed counting to only include directs WITH investments
  - Uses INNER JOIN with user_packages table
  - initializeBooster() on first investment
  - updateBoosterDirectCount() when sponsor gains qualifying direct

FILES CREATED:
✓ app/components/booster/BoosterCountdownTimer.tsx (NEW - 156 lines)
  - Real-time countdown display
  - Shows days remaining / 30
  - Displays current directs count
  - Visual progress bar

KEY BUG FIX:
Previous Implementation:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE sponsor_id = ?
  
Fixed Implementation:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT u.id)
  FROM users u
  INNER JOIN user_packages up ON u.id = up.user_id
  WHERE u.sponsor_id = ? AND up.status = 'active'

VERIFICATION:
✓ First investment initializes booster
✓ Only directs with investments count
✓ UI shows accurate countdown
✓ Bonus paid when 3 qualifying directs within 30 days

TESTING PERFORMED:
- Created user and made first investment
- Verified booster initialized
- Created 3 directs WITHOUT investments - count = 0
- Created 3 directs WITH investments - count = 3
- Verified 3x bonus triggered

PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
- Minimal (indexed query on sponsor_id and user_id)

DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
- No migration needed
- Code changes only

KNOWN ISSUES:
None

NEXT PHASE:
Phase 7 - Reward Calculation
